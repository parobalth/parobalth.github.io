At the time of his passing this year, the DevTeam decided that it would be a fitting tribute to take a number of our favourite quotes from the various Discworld novels and incorporate them into the game. If the above quote is not reason alone to try this marvellous computer game I hope to convince you with my humble thoughts. This is a post about the computer game nethack. When I first read about nethack I tested it for about 3 minutes and thought: \"Oh my god, it's ancient. It's horrible. Why does anybody want to waste his time with nethack? How can I quit?\" My first impression of nethack was dead wrong! Years later somehow I gave nethack another chance or better phrased I gave nethack the first real chance and now I am hooked. I love it. Playing nethack is so much fun. Every game is different. In some aspects it is like reading a good book — the most important things happen in your brain/imagination not on the page or on the screen. So please try it for at least 30 minutes before deciding to quit. I know that learning the keys can take some time especially if you are not yet familiar with the editor vim. Nethack should be a package in every major distribution so installation is hassle free. I recommend the classic commandline-interface for the visuals. Once installed, start nethack by typing nethack at your command-line prompt. I recommend to manually select race, role, gender and alignment and stick with your choice for a few games. For your first games it may be wise to select a class which is well equipped for adventure and combat so don't pick the tourist class. I often play with an elven Ranger or a human wizard. The adventure begins… Once you have chosen your character it is time to baptize your animal. Press ‘ C ‘ (yes, that is a capital C). Now navigate the cursor (with hjkl -keys) to your animal and press ‘ . ‘ . Enter your preferred name and confirm by pressing Enter . Start moving through the first level with the hjkl -keys. As a beginner there is absolutely no chance of winning the game. Try to stay alive. Look for food, gold, weapons and other useful items. From the manpage of nethack: \" To get started you really only need to know two commands. The command ? will give you a list of the available commands (as well as other information) and the command / will identify the things you see on the screen. To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out. Nobody has achieved this yet; anybody who does will probably go down in history as a hero among heros.\" Useful links Read Hook's blogpost about nethack 3.6.0.

Later pre-orders were delayed. NextThing Co. promised me a 9 Dollar Computer — NextThing delievered as promised! I ordered this small $9 computer in January and agreed to pay additional $6.22 for international shipping. In June NextThing asked me to confirm my shipping address and told me: Pre-orders have begun shipping and will continue through mid-July. Once you have confirmed, you will be in the shipping queue. …and then after adress confirmation in another email from NextThing in mid-July: That's right! It has officially left the building … rather our shipping facility in Hong Kong. Either way it's on its way straight away! NextThing also provided a tracking number. I recieved my C.h.i.p. last week. As far as I can tell right now everything went smooth with my order and NextThing delievered as they promised! …but now to the important questions: Does it come with batteries included and with a fair amount of fairy dust? Is it enchanted and encoated by pixies? Is it the holy grail of singleboard computers? Thoughts and opinion Let us just think how incredible this tiny computer is and how much you get for your $9! With this price tag it is an absolute no-brainer and you should definitely get one — if you have the opportunity. Things I like Here are some reasons why I am quite excited about NextThings C.h.i.p.: full root access — this reminds me of a paragraph in Eric S. Raymonds famous FAQ \"How to become a Hacker\" (which is absolutely not about breaking into computers of other people!): \" I'll assume you have a personal computer or can get access to one. (Take a moment to appreciate how much that means. The hacker culture originally evolved back when computers were so expensive that individuals could not own them.) The single most important step any newbie can take toward acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy of Linux or one of the BSD -Unixes, install it on a personal machine, and run it.\" — Read all of the mentioned FAQ here . uses Debian Jessie (stable) repositories — This is great news. Debian is my preferred distribution. You get a ton of high quality packages. Debian has high community standards and a social contract . …and again a paragraph about Linux of Eric S. Raymonds FAQ : \" Learn it. Run it. Tinker with it. Talk to the Internet with it. Read the code. Modify the code. You'll get better programming tools (including C, LISP , Python, and Perl) than any Microsoft operating system can dream of hosting, you'll have fun, and you'll soak up more knowledge than you realize you're learning until you look back on it as a master hacker.\" built in wifi — no need for an external dongle, no reading of documentation and tutorials how to set up a wifi-dongle. built in bluetooth built in 4 GB of NAND storage — no need to buy a storage medium because Chip works out of the box. You may want to use an additional memory stick to get more storage capacity later on. 512 MB ram — The more the merrier — I think it is good enough. preflashed with the Chip OS based on Debian — Chip works out of the box. No need to download, verify, extract and finally dd the iso-image to a storage medium… one Usb-port and one micro- USB port which you can use for a USB -serial connection . female pins — ready for easy connection with standard male pin headers battery support — using chip with a battery seems easy, but I have not tried it yet. Batteries are not included. one tiny button — working like the power button on a normal computer. Things I don't like Here are some points I don't like about NextThings C.h.i.p. It is important to note that I believe many of the points are only temporary issues because C.h.i.p. is still in its pre-order phase: restricted shipping — During the kickstarter and the early pre-order phase NextThing offered world wide shipping. Currently shipping countries are severly limited. It appears that this problem, which at first appeared temporary to me, turned into a permant one. You can't buy/ship a Chip to Poland, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Czech republic, Slovenia and many more countries in the European Union. gpu — Chips were shipped without support for the gpu. My pre-order Chip is one of them. After many months of waiting NextThing released new images with proprietary support for the Mali 400 gpu. To use this new solution a reflash is due. flashing — I haven't flashed my chip yet. I expected a solution that works on a Debian machine from a company which sells a device with an operating system based on Debian. As far as I know NextThing supports a strange \"Ubuntu virtual machine SDK solution\" and a flashing tool for the Chrome browser. No neat command-line solution. There are different batches of Chips with two types of NAND . For additional complexity these two types need different images. This seems like quite a mess to me and way more complicated than it has to be. In contrast think about the Raspberry Pi where you have one image supporting all different Raspberry Pis. dips — dips are adapter boards to add additional functionalities like hdmi or vga. They cost $15 and $10 and seem overpriced compared to the $9 Chip. Verdict Verdict : Chip is a perfect headless single board computer to hack, make and embed into projects. It is unexpensive. It can be a useful device in educational projects or in developing countries. A perfect gift for children and young adults. Chip could be a good computer for Joe Average Hacker, his children and his aunt Tillie, although children and Tillie might prefer a tablet. To reach $9 NextThing compromised on the video output (no vga, no hdmi, read about the reasons for this decision here ). Usability out of the box is very high.

It is a 9$ computer and comes already flashed with the C.h.i.p. OS based on Debian. I took some notes during my first steps with chip: This is the official Documentation . Headless via USB I used this part of the official documentation as a starting point. I like headless ssh-connections but you can't reach your chip because wifi is not yet configured with your network. I used a USB serial connection. Note that I use Debian Jessie (stable). Connect your Chip with a standard USB -to-usb-micro-cable to the usb-port of your Computer/Laptop and run: dmesg -w Output will be similar to: usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7 usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0 usb 1-2: Product: Gadget Serial v2.4 usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Linux 4.3.0-ntc with musb-hdrc cdc_acm 1-2:2.0: This device cannot do calls on its own. It is not a modem. cdc_acm 1-2:2.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device So your Chip is recognized as ‘ ttyACM0 ‘. I had some permission problems because my user was not a member of the dialout group and had to connect with sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 If you add your user to the dialout group you can connect with regular user privileges. Login as root with password chip or with username chip and password chip . User chip is already a member of the sudo group. set up a wifi connection with nmtui: nmtui Now you can ssh into chip but you may want to change the root password and the password of user chip ( passwd ) first, create a normal user ( adduser foo ) and forbid root login via ssh (change settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config). Add your user ‘foo' to the sudo group with ‘ adduser foo sudo ‘ if you like. Now you can ssh to your chip with (replace ‘foo' with your username and ‘xxx.xxx.x.x' with the IP adress of chip): ssh foo@xxx.xxx.x.x Let us have a look at the sources.list: deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free deb http://opensource.nextthing.co/chip/debian/repo jessie main Looks pretty sane to me. Just standard debian stable repositories and one additional NextThing repository (probably for a custom kernel). Output of ‘ uname -r ‘ is 4.3.0-ntc . I have to admit that I am not entirely sure about ‘http.debian.net/debian' (jessie-backports). I changed that line and followed this explanation https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList .

This is the easiest and best solution I could find. Set the duration of the recording with the -d option. Replace ‘foo.gif' with your preferred filename: byzanz-record -d 20 foo.gif or record a video with ‘recordmydesktop' (see code example 0), ‘gtk-recordmydesktop' or use an existing video With ‘avconv' you can directly convert to gif (see code example 1) and skip step 3. Another aproach is to extract stillimages with ‘mplayer' (see code example 2) or with ‘avconv' (see code example 3). convert to ‘gif' with imagemagick (see code example 4) Code example 0 (record a video; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): recordmydesktop -o foobar.ogv Code example 1 (direct video to gif conversion; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): avconv -i foobar.ogv -pix_fmt rgb24 foobar.gif Code example 2 (extraction of still images; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): mplayer -ao null foobar.ogv -vo jpeg:outdir = output Code example 3 (extraction of still images; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): avconv -i foobar.ogv -r 15 output/image-%3d.png Code example 4 (convert stillimages to gif): convert output/* -layers Optimize output.gif This solution produces usable gifs with small filesizes.

I love programms with vim key bindings. There are several firefox plugins with vim key bindings ( read ). I initially started with Vimperator then switched to Pentadactyl and it was great. Problem With the recent switch from iceweasel to firefox-esr in Debian stable (Jessie) Pentadactyl stopped working because all plugins need a valid mozilla signature. There is a rather long thread at Pentadactyls issue tracker with some explanations. Currently there are different options: Continue with pentadactyl: There is still an option to disable strict signature checks (read the section about unsigned Addons in firefox-esr). Use something else: I'm quite happy with VimFx although I was sceptic at first. (read the section \" Solution )\" Unsigned Addons in firefox-esr From: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing# FAQ - Use at your own risk! What are my options if I want to install unsigned extensions in Firefox? The Developer Edition and Nightly versions of Firefox will have a setting to disable signature enforcement. There will also be special unbranded versions of Release and Beta that will have this setting, so that add-on developers can work on their add-ons without having to sign every build. To disable signature checks, you will need to set the xpinstall.signatures.required preference to \"false\". type about:config into the URL bar in Firefox in the Search box type xpinstall.signatures.required double-click the preference, or right-click and selected \"Toggle\", to set it to false. Solution I started to look for alternatives and discovered the VimFX plugin: Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That's why I decided to develop similar extension for Firefox. VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise. – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx's original author. Just install it via the firefox add-on menu. Press ? to to see a help page with all available commands. I had to relearn some key bindings: Action Pentadactyl VimFx Close Tab: d x Back: Ctrl+o H Scrolling feels smooth. Half page down (d) and half page up (u) are hassle free key bindings. I usually scroll a half page down so it is nice to have this command on the homerow. yy to copy the current url is a great shortcut. I think I am going to stick with VimFX - it is not Pentadayctyl but at least it is fast, not in your way and it does not alter the default Firefox appearance.

I also dislike the white font on black background. Don't be afraid with some minor configuration improvements it's going to look great. On the pro side I instantly liked about xterm that it doesn't interfere with the shortcuts of other programs for example mc . For general configuration read the ArchWiki xterm article. When configuring my xterm setup I had to choose a terminal font.

So I had to navigate to a previous command with CTRL-p , add \"echo\", wrap it in singlequotes and add the path to my notes file. Quite a long process to append one command to a file. I already knew that !! repeats the last command but not how to get it into a file instead of being executed. Actually it works quite simple with echo \"!!\" >> ~/commands.txt (which appends your last command to the file ‘commands.txt' in your home directory). I still wanted an easier solution so I created the following bash alias to save me some typing and to be less distraction from the actual task I'm trying to get done: alias ncmd = 'echo $1 >> ~/commands.md' I added the above line to my \"~/.bash_aliases\" file and ran . .bash_aliases to source it. Then I started to test the above solution and noticed issues with complex arguments and wildcards. I also read that it's not recommended to use variables in bash aliases. So I searched for a proper solution and learned quite a lot about bash syntax and how to define functions. Solution My final solution is the following function in my .bashrc file: nn () { echo \" $@ \" >> ~/commands.txt } The power of history expansion Now you can use all the power of history expansion as an argument to the function nn . For example nn \"!!\" appends the last command, nn \"!-5\" appends the 5th last, nn \"!100\" the 100th command in your history file, nn \"!ssh\" appends the first command with ssh in it. Read man history for further examples. Double quotes are mandatory. You can also add explanations like nn \"Commands to copy foo to bar:\" and then append the appropriate commands. Screenshot: fc - fix command fc is a little programm to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list. Read help fc Copyheart: ♡ 2016 by Parobalth.
