Later pre-orders are delayed. NextThing Co. promised me a 9 Dollar Computer — NextThing delievered as promised! I ordered this small $9 computer in January and agreed to pay additional $6.22 for international shipping. In June NextThing asked me to confirm my shipping address and told me: Pre-orders have begun shipping and will continue through mid-July. Once you have confirmed, you will be in the shipping queue. …and then after adress confirmation in another email from NextThing in mid July: That's right! It has officially left the building … rather our shipping facility in Hong Kong. Either way it's on its way straight away! NextThing also provided a tracking number. I recieved my C.h.i.p. last week. As far as I can tell right now everything went smooth with my order and NextThing delievered as they promised! …but now to the important questions: Does it come with batteries included and with a fair amount of fairy dust? Is it enchanted and encoated by pixies? Is it the holy grail of singleboard computers? Thoughts and opinion Let us just think how incredible this tiny computer is and how much you get for your $9! With this price tag it is an absolute no-brainer and you should definitely get one — but it appears you will have to wait till fall. Here are some reasons why I am quite excited about NextThings C.h.i.p.; full root access — this reminds me of a paragraph in Eric S. Raymonds famous FAQ \"How to become a Hacker\" (which is absolutely not about breaking into computers of other people!): \" I'll assume you have a personal computer or can get access to one. (Take a moment to appreciate how much that means. The hacker culture originally evolved back when computers were so expensive that individuals could not own them.) The single most important step any newbie can take toward acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy of Linux or one of the BSD -Unixes, install it on a personal machine, and run it.\" — Read all of the mentioned FAQ here . uses Debian Jessie (stable) repositories — This is great news. Debian is my preferred distribution. You get a ton of high quality packages. Debian has high community standards and a social contract . …and again a paragraph about Linux of Eric S. Raymonds FAQ : \" Learn it. Run it. Tinker with it. Talk to the Internet with it. Read the code. Modify the code. You'll get better programming tools (including C, LISP , Python, and Perl) than any Microsoft operating system can dream of hosting, you'll have fun, and you'll soak up more knowledge than you realize you're learning until you look back on it as a master hacker.\" built in wifi — no need for an external dongle, no reading of documentation and tutorials how to set up a wifi-dongle. built in bluetooth built in 4 GB of NAND storage — no need to buy a storage medium because Chip works out of the box. You may want to use an additional memory stick to get more storage capacity later on. 512 MB ram — I think it is good enough. preflashed with the Chip OS based on Debian — Chip works out of the box. No need to download, verify, extract and finally dd the iso-image to a storage medium… one Usb-port female pins — ready for easy connection with standard male pin headers battery support — using chip with a battery seems easy, but I have not tried it yet. one tiny button — working like the power button on a normal computer. Verdict : Chip is a perfect headless single board computer to hack, make and embed into projects. It is unexpensive. It can be a useful device in educational projects or in developing countries. A perfect gift for children and young adults. Chip could be a good computer for Joe Average Hacker, his children and his aunt Tillie, although children and Tillie might prefer a tablet. To reach $9 NextThing compromised on the video output (no vga, no hdmi, read about the reasons for this decision here ). Usability out of the box is very high.

It is a 9$ computer and comes already flashed with the C.h.i.p. OS based on Debian. I took some notes during my first steps with chip: This is the official Documentation . Headless via USB I used this part of the official documentation as a starting point. I like headless ssh-connections but you can't reach your chip because wifi is not yet configured with your network. I used a USB serial connection. Note that I use Debian Jessie (stable). Connect your Chip with a standard USB -to-usb-micro-cable to the usb-port of your Computer/Laptop and run: dmesg -w Output will be similar to: usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7 usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0 usb 1-2: Product: Gadget Serial v2.4 usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Linux 4.3.0-ntc with musb-hdrc cdc_acm 1-2:2.0: This device cannot do calls on its own. It is not a modem. cdc_acm 1-2:2.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device So your Chip is recognized as ‘ ttyACM0 ‘. I had some permission problems because my user was not a member of the dialout group and had to connect with sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 If you add your user to the dialout group you can connect with regular user privileges. Login as root with password chip or with username chip and password chip . User chip is already a member of the sudo group. set up a wifi connection with nmtui: nmtui Now you can ssh into chip but you may want to change the root password and the password of user chip ( passwd ) first, create a normal user ( adduser foo ) and forbid root login via ssh (change settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config). Add your user ‘foo' to the sudo group with ‘ adduser foo sudo ‘ if you like. Now you can ssh to your chip with (replace ‘foo' with your username and ‘xxx.xxx.x.x' with the IP adress of chip): ssh foo@xxx.xxx.x.x Let us have a look at the sources.list: deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free deb http://opensource.nextthing.co/chip/debian/repo jessie main Looks pretty sane to me. Just standard debian stable repositories and one additional NextThing repository (probably for a custom kernel). Output of ‘ uname -r ‘ is 4.3.0-ntc . I have to admit that I am not entirely shure about ‘http.debian.net/debian' (jessie-backports). I changed that line and followed this explanation https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList . Now let's install aptitude and additional programs (I like aptitude): apt-get update apt-get install aptitude Now you can install additional packages with aptitude (vim, mc, xterm, htop, screen, cmus, …) If you have any questions, suggestions, thoughts and comments please feel free to email me.

This is the easiest and best solution I could find. Set the duration of the recording with the -d option. Replace ‘foo.gif' with your preferred filename: byzanz-record -d 20 foo.gif or record a video with ‘recordmydesktop' (see code example 0), ‘gtk-recordmydesktop' or use an existing video With ‘avconv' you can directly convert to gif (see code example 1) and skip step 3. Another aproach is to extract stillimages with ‘mplayer' (see code example 2) or with ‘avconv' (see code example 3). convert to ‘gif' with imagemagick (see code example 4) Code example 0 (record a video; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): recordmydesktop -o foobar.ogv Code example 1 (direct video to gif conversion; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): avconv -i foobar.ogv -pix_fmt rgb24 foobar.gif Code example 2 (extraction of still images; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): mplayer -ao null foobar.ogv -vo jpeg:outdir = output Code example 3 (extraction of still images; replace foobar.ogv with your filename): avconv -i foobar.ogv -r 15 output/image-%3d.png Code example 4 (convert stillimages to gif): convert output/* -layers Optimize output.gif This solution produces usable gifs with small filesizes.

I love programms with vim key bindings. There are several firefox plugins with vim key bindings ( read ). I initially started with Vimperator then switched to Pentadactyl and it was great. Problem With the recent switch from iceweasel to firefox-esr in Debian stable (Jessie) Pentadactyl stopped working because all plugins need a valid mozilla signature. There is a rather long thread at Pentadactyls issue tracker with some explanations. Currently there are different options: Continue with pentadactyl: There is still an option to disable strict signature checks (read the section about unsigned Addons in firefox-esr). Use something else: I'm quite happy with VimFx although I was sceptic at first. (read the section \" Solution )\" Unsigned Addons in firefox-esr From: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing# FAQ - Use at your own risk! What are my options if I want to install unsigned extensions in Firefox? The Developer Edition and Nightly versions of Firefox will have a setting to disable signature enforcement. There will also be special unbranded versions of Release and Beta that will have this setting, so that add-on developers can work on their add-ons without having to sign every build. To disable signature checks, you will need to set the xpinstall.signatures.required preference to \"false\". type about:config into the URL bar in Firefox in the Search box type xpinstall.signatures.required double-click the preference, or right-click and selected \"Toggle\", to set it to false. Solution I started to look for alternatives and discovered the VimFX plugin: Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That's why I decided to develop similar extension for Firefox. VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise. – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx's original author. Just install it via the firefox add-on menu. Press ? to to see a help page with all available commands. I had to relearn some key bindings: Action Pentadactyl VimFx Close Tab: d x Back: Ctrl+o H Scrolling feels smooth. Half page down (d) and half page up (u) are hassle free key bindings. I usually scroll a half page down so it is nice to have this command on the homerow. yy to copy the current url is a great shortcut. I think I am going to stick with VimFX - it is not Pentadayctyl but at least it is fast, not in your way and it does not alter the default Firefox appearance.

I tried it and was surprised that it looks so ugly. I like programs with sane and usable defaults. Maybe xterm has low profile defaults because it supports very old hardware. For a modern X window system some configuration is necessary. Screenshot of xterm with default settings In my opinion the default font size is way to small and the font looks anachronistic. I also dislike the white font on black background. Don't be afraid with some minor configuration improvements it's going to look great. On the pro side I instantly liked about xterm that it doesn't interfere with the shortcuts of other programs for example mc . For general configuration read the ArchWiki xterm article. When configuring my xterm setup I had to choose a terminal font. After some testing I chose Vera Sans Mono a few months ago and did not regret my decision. \" It is a TrueType font with full hinting instructions, which improve its rendering quality on low-resolution devices such as computer monitors. […] The Bitstream Vera Sans Mono typeface in particular is suitable for technical work, as it clearly distinguishes ‘l' (lowercase L) from ‘1' (one) and ‘I' (uppercase i), and ‘0' (zero) from ‘O' (uppercase o).\" — (Quoted from Wikipedia ) There was no need to install the font on GNU /Linux. It was already installed on my Debianbox. Copy the following lines to your ~/.Xresources file to use it as your xterm font with a reasonable font size. If you don't already have an .Xresources file just create it! URxvt.font: xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:pixelsize = 15 XTerm*faceName: Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:pixelsize = 15 Screenshot of xterm with Vera Sans Mono font Much better than the default font.

I tinkered with my notes file and wondered how to run the current line in bash. I found multiple solutions but all replaced the current line with the output of the command. Although this can be useful it did not help me. It frustrated me that I could not find a proper solution. I don't consider myself a vim beginner anymore and somehow I felt stupid. From vimtutor I remebered ! to run external commands. I even looked it up in vimtutor but I could only find :r !date . The following example runs the current line and replaces it with the output: :. !bash Note that the current line is represented by a dot. You can declare a range with 1,5 (line 1 to 5) or .,$ (current line to end of file). You can also use a line number (e.g. \":5 !bash\").

So I had to navigate to a previous command with CTRL-p , add \"echo\", wrap it in singlequotes and add the path to my notes file. Quite a long process to append one command to a file. I already knew that !! repeats the last command but not how to get it into a file instead of being executed. Actually it works quite simple with echo \"!!\" >> ~/commands.txt (which appends your last command to the file ‘commands.txt' in your home directory). I still wanted an easier solution so I created the following bash alias to save me some typing and to be less distraction from the actual task I'm trying to get done: alias ncmd = 'echo $1 >> ~/commands.md' I added the above line to my \"~/.bash_aliases\" file and ran . .bash_aliases to source it. Then I started to test the above solution and noticed issues with complex arguments and wildcards. I also read that it's not recommended to use variables in bash aliases. So I searched for a proper solution and learned quite a lot about bash syntax and how to define functions. Solution My final solution is the following function in my .bashrc file: nn () { echo \" $@ \" >> ~/commands.txt } The power of history expansion Now you can use all the power of history expansion as an argument to the function nn .
