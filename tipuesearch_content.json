{"pages":[{"url":"http://localhost:8000/vim-run-line","text":"A few days ago I wrote a post how to save history commands to a file. I tinkered with my notes file and wondered how to run the current line in bash. I found multiple solutions but all replaced the current line with the output of the command. Although this can be useful it did not help me. It frustrated me that I could not find a proper solution. I don't consider myself a vim beginner anymore and somehow I felt stupid. From vimtutor I remebered ! to run external commands. I even looked it up in vimtutor but I could only find :r !date . The following example runs the current line and replaces it with the output: :. !bash Note that the current line is represented by a dot. You can declare a range with 1,5 (line 1 to 5) or .,$ (current line to end of file). You can also use a line number (e.g. \":5 !bash\"). Some screenshots for clarification where I'm running line number 1: Hit Enter : Line number 1 is replaced by the output of the fortune command. Solution :.w !bash This stackoverflow-link finally offered the above solution. Again some screenshots for clarification: Hit Enter to execute chosen line: Hit Enter to get back to your unmodified vim buffer: Note that you can also use !sh instead of !bash to type less and that all examples also work in visual mode.

So I had to navigate to a previous command with CTRL-p , add \"echo\", wrap it in singlequotes and add the path to my notes file. Quite a long process to append one command to a file. I already knew that !! repeats the last command but not how to get it into a file instead of being executed. Actually it works quite simple with echo \"!!\" >> ~/commands.txt (which appends your last command to the file ‘commands.txt' in your home directory). I still wanted an easier solution so I created the following bash alias to save me some typing and to be less distraction from the actual task I'm trying to get done: alias ncmd = 'echo $1 >> ~/commands.md' I added the above line to my \"~/.bash_aliases\" file and ran . .bash_aliases to source it. Then I started to test the above solution and noticed issues with complex arguments and wildcards. I also read that it's not recommended to use variables in bash aliases. So I searched for a proper solution and learned quite a lot about bash syntax and how to define functions. Solution My final solution is the following function in my .bashrc file: nn () { echo \" $@ \" >> ~/commands.txt } The power of history expansion Now you can use all the power of history expansion as an argument to the function nn . For example nn \"!!\" appends the last command, nn \"!-5\" appends the 5th last, nn \"!100\" the 100th command in your history file, nn \"!ssh\" appends the first command with ssh in it. Read man history for further examples. Double quotes are mandatory. You can also add explanations like nn \"Commands to copy foo to bar:\" and then append the appropriate commands.
